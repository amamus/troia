Language Basics
=======================

TROIA is a high level programming language which is designed by IAS (Industrial Application Software) for developing business applications.

As a fourth generation programming language (4GL), TROIA has strong abstraction from all hardware specific details, bytes and bits etc.
It has strong ability to operate large collections of information, in a programmer-friendly manner.

TROIA codes are executed by "TROIA Interpreter" which is one of **the main components of Application Server**.
