Keywords and Identifiers
------------------------

As mentioned in previous sections TROIA is a command based language. As a result of it's structure TROIA has more reserved words compared to an ordinary programming language.
Basically, TROIA keywords are consisted from command, function and predefined system variable names. 

It is not allowed to use these words as variable and functions name.
To avoid using TROIA keywords as variable/function name programmers must not use the word that has extra color in TROIA Editor.

Some of the most used TROIA idendifiers are listed below. 

::

	GET            IF             MARKERSET      RETURNVALUE    COPY
	EXECUTE        MESSAGE        SELECT         MARKERPOINT    RETURN
	BREAK          DECIMAL        INSERT         MOVE           SELECTED
