What is "Cross"?
---------------
#what is cross

It is possible to define crosses in two level: "**system level cross**" and "**user level cross**". "system level cross" is valid for all users, so if you define a system level cross, cross is valid for all users that connects to same database. User level crosses are defined for a user or a profile, so this kind of crosses are valid for a user or users defined in a profile.

#loading order

Cross information is loaded while user logging in, so crosses that defined/deleted while user online are ignored until user login again.



How to Define Crosses
---------------------
#define system level cross
#related database table

#define user level cross
#related database table
